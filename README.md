Aristotle Library Services Platform
===================================

The Aristotle Library Services Platform is a collection of loosely coupled web applications 
for enhancing bibliographic and semantic descriptions of resources actively managed 
and curated by memory institutions like libraries. This project is an evolution of 
the [Redis Library Services Platform][RLSP].

## Reason for Name Change
With development of the [Aristotle Library Services Apps][ALSP] there started to develop
a disconnect between most of the active development being apps that communicated with 
[Fedora][FEDORA] digital repositories and never interacted with the Redis bibliographic
datastore, the [Redis Library Services Platform][RLSP] was much more than Redis an may
unduly focus addition on Redis instead of the broader application of open-source 
web apps for Linked Data based interactions with people and systems.
